In the early morning the ship of the group sank after gotten rammed by a huge whale. They could swim in the sea until they reached an island, but all they got left is their wet cloths. They are currently sitting exhausted on the northern beach. It is unlikely that anybody else from the ship survived. It is noon on a sunny day.
