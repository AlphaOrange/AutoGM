The game world consists of a single island in an endless dangerous ocean full of wild animals. The island is nearly round and has a diameter of 1 kilometer. In the middle is a small tropical jungle with exotic fruit and some monkeys. In the jungle are multiple hidden hatches in the ground, under which there are strange or valuable items that do not belong on an untouched island at all and seem out of place.
